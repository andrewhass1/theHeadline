                 At Team Headline, we are eager to spread your voice. 
         We designed The Headline so that writers will feel like they have a 
        serious platform to share their ideas. And readers will hear what serious
        writers have to say.
        <br> <br>
        Social media today is broken. It is not built as a tool to help people, but instead
        is built like a drug so that people will keep checking it and companies will keep making money.
        Social media
        is meant to be addictive. Not here. The Headline was built to reimagine this broken
        system. We wanted to creat a place where
        people could go and read articles on a serious website, but then feel comfortable 
        leaving the
        site and not craving coming back for more.
        This is a non addictive, interesting social media.

<br> <br>
The Headline is the place where serious writers know they will have
an audience who actually reads what they write. There are no pictures or videos 
and no likes or dislikes. Here people will focus on your ideas, and your ideas only.For just one dollar per post,
writers will gain access to an invested audience who cares about 
substantive content. Nowhere else on the internet is content featured
like it is featured here. Every post is up for at least two minutes
on the homepage. This gives writers a fast track to 
sharing their ideas as quickly and as broadly as possible. It is like 
giving a campaign speech on the internet.
Each post will be up for two minutes.

<br> <br>
If a reader is not finished they can visit the archive
section where the post will be up for an additional two hours. The archive section is one of
favorite features of the site because both readers and writers will feel comfortable putting their
phones in their pockets and then returning to the site later and not feeling like they missed anything.
The archives also allows readers to not have to rush, and instead can digest everything they read fully.
At The Headline we believe in the power of simplicity.  One writer. One idea.
<br> 
<br>
 One Headline.
