              At Team Headline we are passionate about making sure your voices are heard. 
              There are so many places on the internet where what people say gets lost. 
              Every blog post, Tweet, or FaceBook post is quickly scrolled over for the next post.
              Not here. This is a place where everything you write, will not get scrolled over. There is
              only one post at a time. That way we guarantee for five minutes people will be forced to read
              what you have to say. And if they are not finished? There is an archive section that saves the last
              50 posts.
              <br> <br>At meetings and during class, at home and with friends, what you say is always ignored.
              We at Team Headline were frustrated with feeling like our voices are never heard. 

                  <br><br>

                 <br> <br>This is not your typical social media. 
                 There are no pictures or  videos. No likes or dislikes. No internet trolls saying
                 in the comment sections.
                Just one intersting person sharing their ideas.
