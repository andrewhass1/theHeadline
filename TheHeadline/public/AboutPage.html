              At Team Headline we are passionate about making sure your voice is heard. 
              There are so many places on the internet where what people say gets lost. 
              Every blog post, Tweet, or FaceBook post is quickly scrolled over.
              Not here. This is place where serious writers know they will have 
              an audience who actually reads what they have to write. There is
              only one post at a time. That way we guarantee for five minutes people will be forced to read
              what you have to say. And if they are not finished? There is an archive section that saves the last
              50 posts.
              <br> <br>The way that news is shared today is broken. 
              Writers no longer care about substance
            all they care about is getting people to click on there article. Everyone eyes are overloaded with too much content.
            We designed The Headline so that people can have a place on the internet where they will not feel overwhelmed.
              

                  <br><br>
                  At The Headline we beleive in the power of simplicity.
                  There are no pictures or  videos. No likes or dislikes. Posts at The Headline finally has a chance to be read. Writers for will have a space where what they say
                can not just be scrolled over. For just one dollar, an invested audience who cares about serious content will finally
                hear what you have to say. What is most exciting about a space like this to produce content is that people who feel like they
                do not have enough of a platform because they do not have a large following will be able to have there voices actually heard.
                 Every post is trending for at least five minutes because
                it will be the only post up at a time.
                  <br><br>
            This is not your typical social media. We are reimaging how readers intake content online. Instead
            of the normal rapid pace and oversaturation of content, at The Headline there will only be one post at a time.
            That way readers can have plenty of time to digest what writers have to say. We do not want to rush you
            so we created an archive section as well.
                 <br> <br> One writer. One idea. One Headline.
