                 At Team Headline, we are eager to spread and amplify your voice. 
There are so many websites and social media platforms that muffle insightful ideas because of overcrowding on pages. People quickly scroll through Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook because there is too much content to digest, much of which is either dull or false. 
Not here. The Headline is the place where serious writers know they will have
an audience who actually reads what they write. There are no pictures or videos and no likes or dislikes. Here people will focus on your ideas, and your ideas only.
<br> <br>
The way that news is shared today is broken. Writers no longer care about substance, just views. Readers are flooded with so much information that it sometimes feels impossible to focus on one thing. The Headline is trying to reimagine this process. Instead of having hundreds of posts on your timeline at one time, we have just one post up. And if they want more during those five minutes? There is an archive section that saves the last 50 posts so people will have the proper time to finish reading.That way readers are given the proper time to focus on the important details of each article.
<br><br>
We designed The Headline so that writers will feel like they have a serious platform to share their ideas. For just one dollar per post, writers will gain access to an invested audience who cares about substantive content. Nowhere else on the internet is content featured like it is featured here. Every post trends for at least five minutes because it is the post at a time. This gives writers a fast track to sharing their ideas as quickly and as broadly as possible. It is like giving a campaign speech to everyone around the country.
<br> <br>
At The Headline we believe in the power of simplicity.  One writer. One idea.
<br>
 One Headline.
