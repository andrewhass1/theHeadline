            At Team Headline, we are eager to spread your voice.
            We designed The Headline so that writers will feel like they have a
           serious platform to share their ideas. And readers will hear what serious
           writers have to say. This is a non addictive Social Media.
           <br> <br>
           Most websites are not built as a tool to help people, but instead
           are built like a drug so that people keep checking and companies keep making money. The more eyeballs a site can attract, the more money they will make.
           Social media
           are built to be addictive and impossible to refuse. Not here. The Headline was built as a place on the internet where
           people can go and read articles on a serious website, but then feel comfortable
           leaving the
           site and not craving coming back for more five minutes later. Readers will feel comfortable putting their phone away, and knowing what they missed will be there waiting when they return.
     
    <br> <br>
    The Headline is a writer's dream. Writers on our site know that they will have
    an audience who actually reads what they write and will not just get scrolled over. Here people will focus on your ideas, and your ideas only. For just one dollar per post,
    writers will gain access to an invested audience who cares about
    substantive content. Nowhere else on the internet is content featured
    like it is featured here. Every post is up for two minutes
    on the homepage. During this time there will be no other post shown. This gives writers a fast track to
    sharing their ideas as quickly and as broadly as possible. It is like
    giving a campaign speech on the internet where everyone is forced to listen to what you have to say.
     
    <br> <br>
    Users don't have to rush to read articles on The Headline. One of our favorite features is the Archive section. The Archives stores the past 50 posts which allows readers to take their time with each article. Instead of rushing a reader, they are able to digest fully what a writer believes before moving on to the next post. The Archives also enables readers to leave the site and return later in the day and know that they will not have missed anything.
     
    At The Headline we believe in the power of simplicity.  One writer. One idea.
    <br>
<br>
 One Headline.
